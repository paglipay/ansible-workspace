# Ansible Workspace

This is a workspace for managing and orchestrating tasks using Ansible.

## Structure

The workspace is organized according to Ansible's best practices.

- `ansible.cfg`: Main configuration file for Ansible.
- `inventory/`: Contains hosts and group variables.
- `roles/`: Contains the roles that tasks can be assigned to.
- `playbooks/`: Contains the playbooks, which are lists of tasks or roles that Ansible will execute on hosts.

## Usage

To run a playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/playbook.yml
```

Replace `playbook.yml` with the name of your playbook.
